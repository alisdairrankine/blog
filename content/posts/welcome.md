This is the Rankine Chronicles. The Rankine Chronicles is the blog
of Ali Rankine. By day, I am the Architect of the software systems
at a major high-street fashion brand, where i wrestle with requirements
and play around with programs. At night, I stick with the code and
build stuff for fun.  I have just started to write the first posts
here, and i'm not sure how it will go, or even what it will end up
looking like, but for now, this will do.

This blog (will) contain musings on software, culture and anything
else that I want to vent about. I plan on formatting the blog with
interconnected topics (similar to Martin Fowler's Bliki). In addition
to articles, I will delve into the myriad of (incomplete) Projects
I have created and any other projects that I'm playing with.
